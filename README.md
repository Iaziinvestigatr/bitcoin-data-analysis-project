### Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive financial analysis of **Bitcoin’s performance and volatility** compared to the **S&P 500** during the year **2021**.  
The analysis combines **Excel-based visual analytics** with **SQL-driven KPI identification**, enabling data-backed insights into Bitcoin’s **risk–return profile**.

---

### Project Workflow

#### 1. Data Import & Setup
- Imported the dataset provided by *Manuela, Head of Finance*, containing **Bitcoin** and **S&P 500** historical data.  
- Data was loaded into **SQL** and **Excel** environments for analysis and visualization.

#### 2. Data Cleaning
- Inspected datasets for **missing values**, **date inconsistencies**, and **formatting errors**.  
- Cleaned and standardized records in **SQL** to ensure integrity and consistency before analysis.

#### 3. KPI Identification Using SQL
- Utilized **advanced SQL queries** to calculate and extract key performance indicators (KPIs), including:  
  - Average daily return and volatility  
  - Monthly percentage change  
  - Correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500  
  - Maximum drawdown and peak recovery periods  
- These KPIs formed the foundation for **comparative analysis** and **dashboard visualizations**.

#### 4. Exploratory Analysis in Excel
- Created **Pivot Tables** and applied **Excel formulas** to explore trends and outliers.  
- Computed **statistical summaries** such as mean, standard deviation, and return differentials.

#### 5. Comparative Analysis
- Compared Bitcoin’s performance metrics against the S&P 500 to assess:  
  - Return potential  
  - Volatility and risk exposure  
  - Market correlation  
- Insights revealed that **Bitcoin offered higher short-term upside** but **significantly higher volatility** than the S&P 500 in 2021.

#### 6. Visualization of Findings
- Developed **interactive charts and graphs** in Excel to visualize:  
  - Daily price movements  
  - Volatility distribution  
  - Comparative performance trends  
- Presented findings through a **professional financial dashboard** for stakeholder review.
